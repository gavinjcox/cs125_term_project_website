        <h2>About My Dog Beasley</h2>

        <p>
            I <em>love</em> my dog Beasley! She is a black lab with a little border collie in her. She is almost nine years old and is still quite hyper. My family and I named her after our Aunt Beasley, since we like naming our animals with human names.
            We got Beasley as a small puppy when I was Thirteen from a shelter. She has little white spots on her feet and big brown eyes. Every since we got her she has always greeted people by putting her nose in between their legs, we find it quite odd.
            Beasley has had quite an eventful life and I plan to document it on this website.
